Ai yoga pose estimation system


A yoga center with yoga pose detection using pose estimation combines traditional yoga
practices with modern technology to enhance the yoga experience for practitioners. By
integrating pose estimation, which is a computer vision technique, the center can provide
real-time feedback and guidance to individuals during their yoga practice. The yoga pose
detection system utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning models to analyze and
interpret the poses of practitioners. It uses image or video input captured through cameras
or sensors to identify and track the positions of key body joints and landmarks. With
this information, the system can accurately recognize and classify different yoga poses
performed by practitioners.
